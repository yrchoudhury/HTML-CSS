    <h1>have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>yeah but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>or if you put cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>
</body>


<p> making a pizza is similar to coding. there are certain things we have to do first. like 
    making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the 
    toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. not all pizzas end up the same,
    but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly.
    you can have anything you need to make many different pizzas using the same base 
    structure that is set up beforehand.</p>

    <h5>This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a pizza, we will list them here.</p>
